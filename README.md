# xChange app

Site address: https://xchange-cavey-app.netlify.app/

Welcome to xChange: A web app that allows quick and easy conversion of the world's top currencies. 

This project is mainly a showcase of typscript with React, and a chance to practice using it. 


## Features

xChange connects to the Free currency API for daily exchange rates of the world's top currencies: https://freecurrencyapi.com/docs.

Choose any of the available base and target currencies and get that day's conversion rate. Use one of the inputs and the app will automatically create the equivilent amount of the other currency based on the conversion rate.  

Interact with the tsparticles animation. What happens when you move the curser and what happens when you click?

Open up a Bootstrap modal containing links to the API documentation and disclaimers. 

Fast and Responsive for any screen size.
